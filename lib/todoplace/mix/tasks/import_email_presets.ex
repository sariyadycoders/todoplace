        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Wardrobe</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Depending upon what you want from the shoot, you can choose fun, casual clothes or something more dressy. Make sure that the clothes are as timeless as possible. Creams, whites, off whites and neutrals look timeless in newborn images.  Avoid really busy logos so the photographs let your family, rather than the clothes, shine.  Please avoid onesies with wording on them (like big brother, little sister)  as well as collared shirts or dresses for newborns - they just don't photograph well.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Preparation Tips</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. The morning of your session, be sure to give the baby a bath and bring extra wipes for a last-minute nose cleaning (very important to have a clean nose!) and for eye boogers! The bath really helps for a fantastic shoot.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. They should also be fully fed (45 minutes feed) as close to you leaving for the studio as possible. Please allow up to 2-4 hours for these sessions (2 hours for bottle-fed or 4 hours+ for exclusively breastfed).</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. If you are pumping or the babies are on formula, please bring a lot of extra bottles so if they get hungry they can have a snack (don't worry it won’t make them get off schedule - they are burning more calories on a shoot so they get hungrier quicker!). Please also have their pacifier handy if they have one - these are magic to get the babies through the shoot sometimes!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. The space where we are photographing the baby needs to be very warm–warmer than will probably be comfortable for everyone else– to keep the baby happy and sleepy. If the shoot is at your home, plan on turning up the heat or using a space heater to make the room warm.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If you have anything specific in mind for your session, please let me know your thoughts and I will try, if I can, to incorporate them into the shoot. It helps to know any requests before the shoot so I can prep for them in advance. Please send along any images from my website or Instagram account that you love so I can see what you are looking for from the shoot. Don't worry if you don't send any, I will work my magic!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Most importantly, in this busy time of your life I want you to slow down and relax!  I want you to enjoy this precious time and I do not rush portrait sessions. Our goal is to make you as comfortable as possible. Only then will I be able to capture the moments you will fall in love with. Following the steps above will help ensure that you will enjoy your session by getting off to a good start. The more you are prepared for your session the more you will enjoy the photo shoot process.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After your photoshoot, your images will be delivered via a beautiful online gallery within {{delivery_time}} after the shoot date. If you need one sooner for a birth announcement, we can discuss which image you think you would like to use.</span></p>

If you are able to bring bottles of pumped milk or formula I will say that the shoots where the moms are exclusively breastfeeding are 2X as long as the ones where you can just top them off with a bottle. I strongly recommend that - a game changer for the baby's experience on the shoot.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. Bring a pacifier</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Prep for any older siblings</strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Be excited.  Be happy :) It is family photo day - we are going to have lots of fun! Tell them we will be going to 'play' at the photo studio or at your home. It's Mommy and Daddy's friend - it will be so fun.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. Show them photos of the last family photo shoot we did or other family photos you have so they can understand what is happening. Children don’t easily connect the experience of being in front of a camera with the images you show them later. If you can help them realize what they’re doing, they’re much more likely to participate willingly. Tell them how happy the photos made you and remind them what fun they had taking those photos.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Let them in on the why. For example: “We are doing this for Mommy/Daddy/Grandma /Aunt Mabel with 5 cats” or even just “We need new pictures for our walls as you have grown up so much!”</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. If your child is over age three, bribery works. Offer them a trip to the playground, a giant ice cream, or a toy for great behavior on the shoot. The offer of a reward works wonders drawing out children’s best behavior on a shoot! We can’t recommend bribery enough.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">5. When we start the shoot - try not to have them holding any item that you won't want in the photos. For example, If they have a lovey, a pacifier, or a sippy cup, please don't have them holding it when they get to the shoot or I may not be able to get it out of their hands, which means it’ll end up in your photos.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">6. Act excited–kids feed off any negativity so if any adult or older kid in the group isn't into getting their photo taken please just have them fake it for the shoot!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Relax! Have fun! We will have a blast and I'll capture those special moments for you!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In general, email is the best way to get a hold of me, however, If you have any issues {{total_time}} or an emergency, you can call or text me on the shoot day at {{photographer_cell}}.</span></p>

        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I wanted to send along a reminder about how to best prepare for our upcoming shoot. Please read through as it is very helpful to our shoot.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What to expect at your shoot:</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Please arrive at your shoot on time or a few minutes early to be sure you give yourself a little time to get settled and finalize your look before we start shooting. Often little ones will need a snack, a nose wipe and/or a few minutes to adjust to a new environment.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. Remember that to kids, a photoshoot is usually a totally new experience. They may not be themselves in front of the camera. With most childrens’ sessions the window of opportunity for great moments happens for 10-15 minutes. After that they may get nervous about being away from their parents and aren't sure of what to do with all the attention or just get bored. All of this is normal!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Practice Patience! I do not rush the shoot or push the children into something they don’t want to do – that doesn’t make for an enjoyable experience for anyone (or a memorable photo!). Patience is key in these situations. we don’t force them to do a shot, they will usually willingly cooperate in their own time – this is where and when we get the great shots.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. Most importantly, in this busy time of your life, I want you to slow down and relax! My goal is to make you as comfortable as possible. Only then will I be able to capture the moments you will fall in love with.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">How to prepare for your shoot:</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Depending upon what you want from the shoot, you can choose clothes that are fun and casual or dressy. Make sure that the clothes are timeless as possible. Avoid really busy logos and prints so the photographs really let your family, rather than the clothes, shine. If you have any questions or need help with wardrobe choices - simply let us know! I am here to help.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. Children (and parents)  should be fully fed if possible. If not, please have some snacks (not candy or sugary snacks) for them while I am on the shoot! Rested and full bellies make for a happier session. Please make sure their faces are clean and free of boogers if possible! Also, please do bring a change of clothes just in case - accidents can happen!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Don’t stress! We are working together to make these photos. I will help guide you through the process to ensure that you look amazing in your photos.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following the steps above will help ensure that you will enjoy your session by getting off to a good start. The more you are prepared for your session, the more you will enjoy the photo shoot process.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I am looking forward to working with you!</span></p>

        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Be on time or early. Our session commences precisely at the scheduled start time. I don’t want you to miss out on any of the time you booked.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. Show them photos of the last family photo shoot we did or other family photos you have so they can understand what is happening. Children don’t easily connect the experience of being in front of a camera with the images you show them later. If you can help them realize what they’re doing, they’re much more likely to participate willingly. Tell them how happy the photos made you and remind them what fun they had taking those photos.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Make the photoshoot seem like an adventure and not a stressful chore. Call it “Family Photo Day!” and help the kids see me as a friend.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. Let them in on the "why". For example: “We are doing this for mommy/daddy/grandma/Aunt Mabel with 5 cats” or even just “We need new pictures for our walls as you have grown up so much!”</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">5. If your child is over age three, bribery works. Offer them a trip to the playground, a giant ice cream, or a toy for great behavior on the shoot. The offer of a reward works wonders drawing out children’s best behavior on a shoot! We can’t recommend bribery enough.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">6. When we start the shoot - try not to have them holding any item that you won't want in the photos. For example, If they have a lovey, a pacifier, or a sippy cup, please don't have them holding it when we get to the shoot or I may not be able to get it out of their hands, which means it’ll end up in your photos.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">7. Act excited–kids feed off any negativity so if any adult or older kid in the group isn't into getting their photo taken please just have them fake it for the shoot!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">8. Relax! Have fun! We will have a blast and I'll capture those special moments for you!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In general, email is the best way to get a hold of me, however, If you have any issues finding me or the location {{total_time}}, or an emergency, you can call or text me on the shoot day at {{photographer_cell}}.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Can't wait!</span></p>

        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I wanted to send along a reminder about how to best prepare for our upcoming shoot. Please read through it as it is very helpful to our shoot.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What to expect at your shoot:</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Please arrive at your shoot on time or a few minutes early to be sure you give yourself a little time to get settled and finalize your look before we start shooting. Often little ones will need a snack, a nose wipe, and/or a few minutes to adjust to a new environment.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. Remember that to kids, a photoshoot is usually a totally new experience. They may not be themselves in front of the camera. With most children's sessions, the window of opportunity for great moments happens for 10-15 minutes. After that,  they may get nervous about being away from their parents and aren't sure of what to do with all the attention or just get bored. All of this is normal!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Practice Patience! I do not rush the shoot or push the children into something they don’t want to do – that doesn’t make for an enjoyable experience for anyone (or a memorable photo!). Patience is key in these situations. we don’t force them to do a shot, they will usually willingly cooperate in their own time – this is where and when we get the great shots.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. Most importantly, in this busy time of your life, I want you to slow down and relax! My goal is to make you as comfortable as possible. Only then will I be able to capture the moments you will fall in love with.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">How to prepare for your shoot:</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Depending upon what you want from the shoot, you can choose clothes that are fun and casual or dressy. Make sure that the clothes are as timeless as possible. Avoid really busy logos and prints so the photographs really let your family, rather than the clothes, shine. If you have any questions or need help with wardrobe choices - simply let us know! I am here to help.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. Children (and parents)  should be fully fed if possible. If not, please have some snacks (not candy or sugary snacks) for them while I am on the shoot! Rested and full bellies make for a happier session. Please make sure their faces are clean and free of boogers if possible! Also, please do bring a change of clothes just in case - accidents can happen!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Don’t stress! We are working together to make these photos. I will help guide you through the process to ensure that you look amazing in your photos.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following the steps above will help ensure that you will enjoy your session by getting off to a good start. The more you are prepared for your session, the more you will enjoy the photo shoot process.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I am looking forward to working with you!</span></p>

        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Here are some last-minute tips to make your session (and your photos) amazing:</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Be on time or early. Our session commences precisely at the scheduled start time. I don’t want you to miss out on any of the time you booked.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. Show children photos of the last family photo shoot we did or other family photos you have so they can understand what is happening. They don’t easily connect the experience of being in front of a camera with the images you show them later. If you can help them realize what they’re doing, they’re much more likely to participate willingly. Tell them how happy the photos made you and remind them what fun they had taking those photos.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Make the photoshoot seem like an adventure and not a stressful chore. Call it “Family Photo Day!” and help the kids see me as a friend.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. Let them in on the "why". For example: “We are doing this for Mommy/Daddy/Grandma/Aunt Mabel with 5 cats” or even just “We need new pictures for our walls as you have grown up so much!”</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">5. If your child is over age three, bribery works. Offer them a trip to the playground, a giant ice cream, or a toy for great behavior on the shoot. The offer of a reward works wonders drawing out children’s best behavior on a shoot! We can’t recommend bribery enough.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">6. When we start the shoot - try not to have them holding any item that you won't want in the photos. For example, If they have a lovey, a pacifier, or a sippy cup, please don't have them holding it when we get to the shoot or I may not be able to get it out of their hands, which means it’ll end up in your photos.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">7. Act excited–kids feed off any negativity so if any adult or older kid in the group isn't into getting their photo taken please just have them fake it for the shoot!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">8. Relax! Have fun! We will have a blast and I'll capture those special moments for you!</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In general, email is the best way to get a hold of me, however, If you have any issues finding me or the location {{total_time}}, or an emergency, you can call or text me on the shoot day at {{photographer_cell}}.</span></p>
